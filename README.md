## [Project2 : PowerBI-Capstone-Project on Adventure work Sales Data](https://github.com/praveen311094/PowerBI-Capstone-Project)

This is my Power Bi project worked on Adventure work Sales Data added the dataset in the git repo.

- Performed Cleaning and Formatting of data in Power Query and Loaded in Power Bi Desktop

- Build relationships among the tables in the modeling tab and with the help of data view we can inspect, explore, and understand data in our Power BI Desktop model

- With the help of Visualizations pane built interactive visuals from the data loaded

### In Power Bi my favorite visuals are:

**Line Chart** - To see the trend where we are standing in business now

**Pie Chart** - To know the how much percentage of data occupied

**Guage Visual** - To check the target vs actual status

**AI Visuals** - Especially Key Influencers where we can check which factors are mainly impacting towards profit or loss
